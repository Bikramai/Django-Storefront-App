## What is Django?

Django is free and open-source framework for building web apps with Python.

It helps us to build the website with lesstime with fewer line code.

## Companies using Django

- Youtube

- DropBox

Django is what we call batteries included with comes a lot of features so that we don’t have to code from the scratch.

## For example :-
## Django Features
- The admin site(interface)-managing our data which is huge time saver.
- Object-relational mapper(ORM) - that abstract database so we can query or precise data without  writing a lot of SQL code
- Authentication
- Caching data and much more

Saying the framework is better than Django -its kinda like saying Ferrari than truck coz it is faster. But if you wanna move something we are not going to use Ferrari for that. So Wise software engineer doesn’t pick up the framework merely base on performance. There is so many things we need to take in to count like maturity of framework, how stablility from one version to another, it’s learning curve, and size of cummunity and so on(Maturity, Stability, Difficulty, Community).
